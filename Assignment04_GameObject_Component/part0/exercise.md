- List the components that you think are associated with some of the game objects you see in the following screenshot.
- You should be able to identify **at least 3** individual 'components' that make up the 'game objects' shown.
  - Remember that components are things that could be added to GameObjects, such that they can change or add behavior to that particular game object.
  - For reference, you may look at other Game Engines like Unity3D for inspiration: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html
